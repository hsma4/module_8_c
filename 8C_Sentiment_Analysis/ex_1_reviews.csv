The movie was extremely exciting from beginning to end.  I loved every minute!
"This was a disaster – poor storytelling, poor artistic direction, poor acting.  Avoid."
The actors were all excellent and the story was gripping.
"I thought some scenes were ok, but largely the story just didn’t grip me."
I think this is the best film I have ever watched.
The acting was great.  The special effects were rubbish.
